# fitness-tracker

This fitness tracker allows the user to view, create and track their daily workouts by date, duration, distance, reps, sets and total weight. If the exercise happens to be a cardio exercise, the user will be able to track the distance traveled.<br>
On the stats page, the user can track their progress over the course of the past seven days, displaying in graph form the duration of each of their exercises for the week as well as the total weight combined.<br>
This project utilizes Mongoose as the relational database and Express as the server.
